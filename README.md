# Project Euler Solutions
This repository houses a collection of code (or work-in-progress code) to work out solutions to the problems from https://projecteuler.net/

As this code is usually not meant to be reused, and only to solve the problem in question, much of it is not heavily optimised. On some occasions I have decided to implement a more optimised method, such as implementing a [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) to generate prime numbers for problem 7.

## Format
Project Euler is a set of mathematical problems that are meant to be solved programmatically. The problems can be found at: https://projecteuler.net/archives   

Any programming language can be used, and in general code to work out any of the answers should be able to run in a minute or less (although this is not a requirement to pass). A problem will be marked as completed as soon as a correct answer is validated on the website. No code needs to be uploaded to validate completion, although once you have completed a problem, a forum thread for that problem unlocks in which different approaches or optimisations are discussed, and code can be shared.
