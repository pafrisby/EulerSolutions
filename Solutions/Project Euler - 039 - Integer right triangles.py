"""
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

"""
Problem 9 involved finding the only Pythagorean triplet where perimeter = 1000

Let a,b,c and c be the sides of a right angled triangle, where c is hypotenuse,
and if a & b are not equal, let a be the shorter side, therefore a <= b < c

Refactor code from problem 9 to increment a counter when a triplet is found,
instead of immediately returning it, so that it can return the total number of
valid triplets for a given perimeter.

let a,b,c be a Pythagorean triplet with perimeter p

2a,2b,2c will also form a triplet with perimeter 2p

thus, perimeter 2p will have at least as many triplets as perimeter p

therefore we don't need to check below half of the perimeter limit, as every
perimeter in the lower half will have a counterpart in the upper half with at
least as many triplets.

max = 0
maxPerimeter = 0
For perimeter from 500 to 1000
    if pythagoreanTriplets(perimeter) > max
        max = pythagoreanTriplets(perimeter)
        maxPerimeter = perimeter

print (maxPerimeter)

"""
Even though I had already implemented some optimisations in original solution
(e.g. only checking perimeter values greater than or equal to half of the limit)
it was taking over 20 seconds to computer the answer.

After some further consideration I came up with a more efficient approach.

Instead of working out triplets one perimeter length at a time, you can iterate
through every possible integer combination of a,b and for each, check if c is
also integral.

If so, we work out the perimeter and increment a counter for that perimeter

Once all combinations of a,b have been checked, simply check with perimeter has
the most solutions.

Further information on the specifics can be seen in inline comments.

Below is a comparison of the time taken using both functions for a variety of
limits. Times given to 2 significant figures of accuracy.

-------  ---------------------------  -----------------  ------------------

While the compute time for the optimised solution still grows quite quickly as
the limit grows, it is a lot faster at every tested limit compared to original
solution. For the limit of 1,000, the optimised solution is ~500 times faster.
